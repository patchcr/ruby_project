FitAnalyzer
	module
		method to read ARGV
		method to search directory
		pass file to parser

class Parser/Interpreter
	accepts file and looks for structures/contexts

class Context
	dictates how much information is necessary to represent the object
	when a context (e.g. Table) is completed, the enclosing components
	are packaged into a TableContext object and sent to the TableStrategy 
	class for processing
	< Table
	< Includes
	< HTML
	< Variables
	< Page
	< Suite
	< Component Def

class Strategy
	the Strategy class will accept a context object. The class methods will 
	determine what type of strategy should be used and initialize a sub-
	class for the specific algorithm necessary for that table type.
	< Table
		< Script
		< Lf Script
		< Datapool
		< Scenario
		< Component Def
	< Component Def (context that holds current state for all comp defs so far)
		< ID
		< XPath
	< Page
		< TestPage
		< SuiteSetUp
		< Setup
		< etc.

class Rule
	The Rule class will have numerous sub-classes. The basic idea is that
	it will accept a certain type of Context object and return a violation
	if one is found for that specific rule.
	< Table
		< Wait
		< No Log message
	< Component Def
		< Duplicates (this would be able to accept a component def of any type
					(ID, xpath, etc) and search for global duplicates)
		< Look for malformed xpaths or hardcoded text
	< etc.
